As a protest, he trashed all the photos right in front of the groom.The hungry photographer, who is apparently the friend of the groom and a full-time dog groomer took to Reddit to share his sob story. "I am not really a photographer, I am a dog groomer," he began narrating. As per his story, he was "convinced" to shoot at his friend's wedding who was on a "shoestring budget." He started around 11 am and was due to finish at 7:30 pm. However, around lunchtime, he noticed that he was not allotted a spot at the table. When he asked the groom for a brief break for "20 mins to get something to eat and drink" the groom not only outrightly refused, instead he was insolent and cheeky. "He tells me I need to either be (the) photographer or leave without pay," he wrote on Reddit."So, I deleted the photos!""With the heat, being hungry, being generally annoyed at the circumstances, I asked if you are sure, and he said yes! So, I deleted all the photos I took in front of him and took off saying I am not a photographer anymore," the vexed photographer wrote on Reddit. "If I was to be paid R2500, honestly at that point I would have paid R2500 just for a glass of cold water and somewhere to sit down for 5 minutes," he added. Lastly, he ended the post by asking netizens' to make their own judgments about the situation.
